~~~~exercism/caution

Unlike most “Hello World” exercises on Exercism, WebAssembly requires an extra change to the code you are provided with in the start file.
As well as changing the string itself, you must also change the **length of the greeting** in the function definition.
See the comment in the starter code for more details.
